/**
 * ### Setup
 *
 * #### Callback URL
 * ```
 * https://example.com/api/auth/callback/auth0
 * ```
 *
 * #### Configuration
 *
 * Import the provider and configure it in your **Auth.js** initialization file:
 *
 * ```ts title="pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts"
 * import NextAuth from "next-auth"
 * import Auth0Provider from "next-auth/providers/auth0"
 *
 * export default NextAuth({
 *   providers: [
 *     Auth0Provider({
 *       clientId: process.env.AUTH0_ID,
 *       clientSecret: process.env.AUTH0_SECRET,
 *     }),
 *   ],
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * ### Resources
 *
 * - [Auth0 docs](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate)
 *
 * ### Notes
 *
 * The Auth0 provider comes with a [default configuration](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/blob/main/packages/core/src/providers/auth0.ts). To override the defaults for your use case, check out [customizing a built-in OAuth provider](https://authjs.dev/guides/configuring-oauth-providers).
 *
 * ## Help
 *
 * If you think you found a bug in the default configuration, you can [open an issue](https://authjs.dev/new/provider-issue).
 *
 * Auth.js strictly adheres to the specification and it cannot take responsibility for any deviation from
 * the spec by the provider. You can open an issue, but if the problem is non-compliance with the spec,
 * we might not pursue a resolution. You can ask for more help in [Discussions](https://authjs.dev/new/github-discussions).
